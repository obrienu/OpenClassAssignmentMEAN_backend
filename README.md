You will create a RESTful API for an online recipe app using Express, Node, and MongoDB. Your Express app will be served up by a Node server running on port 3000, and it will be connected to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. You will be implementing the following endpoints:

GET /api/recipes — returns all recipes in database
GET /api/recipes/:id — returns the recipe with the provided ID from the database
POST /api/recipes — adds a new recipe to the database
PUT /api/recipes/:id — modifies the recipe with the provided ID
DELETE /api/recipes/:id — deletes the recipe with the provided ID
